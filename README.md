Open the following link in your browser: 


Bar chart: 
Top 100 streamed songs on Spotify, displayed with their number of streams. Sliders on the left can help you filter the songs by number of streams. Drop-down menus on the right help you choose whether to colour the bars to indicate duration, loudness or tempo, and whether to sort the bars by number of streams or by different song features. This allows you to explore how song features relate to number of streams, as well as to pinpoint the song scoring highest or lowest in a certain feature.
