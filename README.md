Bar chart: 
Top 100 streamed songs on Spotify, displayed with their number of streams. Sliders on the left can help you filter the songs by number of streams. Drop-down menus on the right help you choose whether to colour the bars to indicate duration, loudness or tempo, and whether to sort the bars by number of streams or by different song features. This allows you to explore how song features relate to number of streams, as well as to pinpoint the song scoring highest or lowest in a certain feature. 

Heatmap:
Spearman correlation calculation used and values mapped to color gradient from blue to red. Blue signifies low correlation and red signifies high correlation (1 = highest correlation value). Hover-over individual cell allows for a pop-up text on the bottom of the heatmap that reveals the correlation calculation value.
