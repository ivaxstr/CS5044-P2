Introduction:
Our Spotify's Top 100 Most Streamed Songs (All-Time) visualization allows you to view songs by ten different
song features: Acousticness, Danceability, Energy, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Speechiness, Valence, Duration,
Loudness and Tempo, and compare those song features to number of streams. The dataset for this visualization is
linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amaanansari09/most-streamed-songs-all-time.

Acousticness, Danceability, Energy, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Speechiness and Valence are song features with a
value from [0,1]. The descriptions for each feature are listed below. For more information on each feature, you 
can consult this link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/ludovicocuoghi/spotify-top-100-streamed-songs-analysis.

Acousticness: [0–1] Confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic.
Danceability: [0–1] Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on musical attributes including tempo, 
	      rhythm, stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
Energy: [0–1] Perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
Instrumentalness: [0–1] Predicts whether a track contains no vocals (values above 0.5 represent instrumental
		  tracks whereas rap songs would have a score close to 0).
Liveness: [0–1] Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.
Speechiness: [0–1] Detects the presence of spoken words in a track (values above 0.66 describe tracks that are
	     probably made entirely of spoken words, 0.33–0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and 
	     speech, and values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks).
Valence: [0–1] Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive
	 (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

Duration, Loudness and Tempo are on different scales and are represented by the color gradient in the bar 
graph visualization. These feature descriptions are below.

Duration: [Minutes in decimal] How long the track is.
Loudness: [-60–0 dB] The average volume across an entire track.
Tempo: [0–300 BPM] The speed or pace of a given piece, as derived from the estimated average beat duration.

How to Interact with our Visualization:
Choose Duration, Loudness or Tempo to see how specific songs in the top 100 rank in the bar graph. You can then
sort the songs in the bar graph by the [0,1] features. Use the song release date and stream number sliders to
filter the data. Hovering over the chart will give you a pop-up to provide more details on the specific song.

Heatmap Interaction:
To see how the [0,1] song features correlate to each other, you can see our heatmap visualization here: <link>.
Hovering over an individual cell highlights the pertaining cell and displays details of the cell’s correlation
value in the text pop-up on the bottom. Could you have predicted which song features were more correlated to 
each other?

Dataset Considerations:
(1) This dataset was most recently updated early March 2023. Spotify's top 100 streamed songs may have changed.
(2) Spotify was founded in 2006. A balance between more recent songs having higher streams and having enough time to
gain popularity should be considered when analyzing this dataset.
